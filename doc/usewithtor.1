.SH NAME
.BR usewithtor
\- Shell wrapper to simplify the use of the torsocks(8) library to
transparently allow an application to use a SOCKS proxy. 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B usewithtor
.RB [application\ [application's\ arguments]]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B usewithtor
is a wrapper between the torsocks library and the application what you
would like to run socksified.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB[application\ \fB[application's\ arguments]]
run the application as specified with the environment (LD_PRELOAD) set
such that torsocks(8) will transparently proxy SOCKS connections in
that program.

.SH USEWITHTOR VERSUS TORSOCKS
.B usewithtor
runs
.B torsocks(1)
with the default configuration file,
located at
.B /usr/local/etc/torsocks.conf.
Running torsocks(1) directly means
that no configuration file will be used (unless you manually set the
TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE or TSOCKS_CONF_FILE environment variable), instead
.B torsocks(8)
will
use defaults that are sensible for most Tor installations.

.SH USEWITHTOR VERSUS TORIFY
.B usewithtor(1)
and
.B torify(1)
intend to achieve the same ends for most
practical purposes. However
.B torify(1)
will use a default tsocks installation if one exists.
.B Usewithtor(1)
will only ever use a
.B torsocks(8)
installation.
