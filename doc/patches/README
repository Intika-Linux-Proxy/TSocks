This is a list of the patches applied to tsocks between it's last
official release and 15/06/08. All changes applied to the source after
that date are recorded in the Changelog.

NB: These patches are stored for historical reasons only. I have not
    confirmed that they all apply cleanly to the tsocks source. I do not
    know in what order they should be applied.

File: getaddrbyhost.patch (Robert Hogan)
Date: 18/06/08
Description:
Add support for getaddrbyhost.

File: compilewarnings.patch (Robert Hogan)
Date: 2007
Description:
  Suppresses a number of compile warnings. Also introduces reasonable defaults
  for use of Tor.


File: getpeername.patch (Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>)
Date: Sat, 27 Mar 2004 13:20:56 +0100
Description:
  "If we are not done setting up the connection yet, getpeername() should
  return -1 and ENOTCONN.

  This is necessary since some applications, when using non-blocking connect,
  (like ircII) use getpeername() to find out if they are connected already.

  This results in races sometimes, where the client sends data to the socket
  before we are done with the socks connection setup.  Another solution would
  be to intercept send().

  This could be extended to actually set the peername to the peer the
  client application has requested, but not for now.

  this patch is almost the same, only it uses state != DONE  instead of
  state == CONNECTING to find out when to send ENOTCONN back.

  this patch tries to also do continue the socks setup in getpeername(),
  if it isn't done yet."


File: infiniteloop.patch (Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>)
Date: Sat, 20 Mar 2004 11:41:41 +0100
Description:
  "If the server just disconnects when tsocks expects a reply, tsocks
  will get stuck in an infinite busy loop."


File: localaddresses.patch (Roger Dingledine)
Date: Sat, 01 Apr 2006 18:17:50 -0500
Description:
  "I just noticed that tsocks hard-codes the 127.0.0.0/8 subnet
  as being "local", meaning it won't ever go through the socks
  proxy.

  The Tor controller's mapaddress command can assign virtual addresses
  in the 127/8 space: see section 3.8 of
  http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/control-spec.txt

  We think this behavior should be allowed. Here's a patch to tsocks to
  make it not always hard-code its local network."


File: conffile.patch ( Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org>)
Date: Fri, 03 Jun 2005 08:43:59 -0400
Description: tsocks(8) says TSOCKS_CONFFILE but should say TSOCKS_CONF_FILE
Details:
  "The tsocks(8) man page says TSOCKS_CONFFILE but should say
  TSOCKS_CONF_FILE.  Though this is a documentation error I don't think
  it qualifies as minor.  For me the program didn't work at all because
  I needed to run it with an alternative config file, and I needed to
  download the source to figure out the problem."


File: tordns.patch (Total Information Security)
Date: 2005-10-XX (?)
Original Reference: http://www.totalinfosecurity.com/patches/tor.php
Description:
  "Patch from Total Information Security to resolve the DNS leakage problem
  and allow access to addresses with nonstandard hostnames (e.g. those ending
  in .onion)."

Notes:
  'Total Information Security' appears to be defunct so the original link for
  the patch is now dead. The patch stored here was taken from :
