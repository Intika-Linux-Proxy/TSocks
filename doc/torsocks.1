.SH NAME
.BR torsocks
\- Shell wrapper to simplify the use of the torsocks(8) library to
transparently allow an application to use a SOCKS proxy. Basically a renamed, patched tsocks.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B torsocks
.RB [application\ [application's\ arguments]]
.br
or
.B torsocks
.RB [on|off]

.B torsocks
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B torsocks
is a wrapper between the torsocks library and the application what you
would like to run socksified.
.SH SUMMARY

By default, torsocks will assume that it should connect to the SOCKS proxy
running at 127.0.0.1 on port 9050. This is the default address and port for
Tor's socks server on most installations.

In order to use a configuration file, you must set the environment variable
TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE with the location of the file.

If TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE is not set, torsocks will attempt to read the configuration
file at /usr/local/etc/torsocks.conf. If that file cannot be read, torsocks will
use sensible defaults for most Tor installations, i.e. it will assume that
you want to use a SOCKS proxy running at 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port 9050.

For further information on configuration, see
.B torsocks.conf(5).

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB[application\ \fB[application's\ arguments]]
run the application as specified with the environment (LD_PRELOAD) set
such that torsocks(8) will transparently proxy SOCKS connections in
that program
.IP \fB[on|off]
this option adds or removes torsocks(8) from the LD_PRELOAD environment
variable. When torsocks(8) is in this variable all executed
applications are automatically socksified. If you want to
use this function, you HAVE to source the shell script from yours,
like this: "source /usr/bin/torsocks" or ". /usr/bin/torsocks"
.br
Example:
.br
". torsocks on" -- add the torsocks lib to LD_PRELOAD
.br
". torsocks off" -- remove the torsocks lib from LD_PRELOAD
.IP \fB[show|sh]
show the current value of the LD_PRELOAD variable
.IP \fB<without\ any\ argument>
create a new shell with LD_PRELOAD including torsocks(8).
